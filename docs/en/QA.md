## Frequently asked questions about MDS Wallet

### Are the imported token stored by MediShares?

No, MDS Wallet is a decentralized wallet which means the imported tokens are stored in user’s own wallet and MediShares will not save any information of user’s keystore.

### Does MDS Wallet supports the wallet imported from other Wallet like Imtoken? 

Sure! However, only the wallets created on MDS Wallet could join the Crypto Protect Contract as we can’t guarantee the security issue of other wallets.

### What if I can’t find my Token?
